##Explainability in Dynamic Directed Graph Neural Networks:
In this framework, we formulate explainability within dynamic and directed graph neural networks by focusing on both temporal and graph topological aspects that contribute to changes in the graph structure over time.

##Key Features
Post-hoc Explanations: The explanations for changes in the graph are generated after the fact. They are conditioned on:
- The input edge
- The previous state of the graph
- The trained base model (refer to Section E for details)

##Unique Approach
Our approach is unique in that existing explanations for graph neural networks predominantly pertain to node classification networks. In contrast, our focus is on dynamic graph neural networks characterized by temporally varying topologies.
This framework is specifically designed for a spatio-temporal predictive model of object dynamics, aimed at enhancing proactive robot assistance. Notably, our task diverges from traditional link prediction due to the generative nature of the model.
